Here's a quick run-down on the Irrduino controller web API:

Turn off everything (all zones):
http://irrduinoctrl.org/off
    returns: {"zones":"ALL OFF"}

Get system status (new as of today)
http://irrduinoctrl.org/status
    returns: {"system status":"ready"}
    - or: if a zone is running:
    returns: {"zoneX":"running"} // currently "pinX" = bug!

Activate Zones: (syntax: zone[1-9]/on/[1-10]) zone X, ON for N minutes
http://irrduinoctrl.org/zone1/on/1
    returns: {"zone1":"ON","time":"1"}
    
Provoke a report call (for testing only)
http://irrduinoctrl.org/testreport/irrduinoserver.org:8080/datadrop?what=1&ever=2&you=3&want=4
