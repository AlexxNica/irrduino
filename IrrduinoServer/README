IrrduinoServer
==============

This is the server component of Irrduino.  It's a Python Google App Engine
application.

Running
-------

Make sure you have the Google App Engine for Python installed and run the
following from the current directory:

  dev_appserver.py .

Global TODOs
------------

Fix pdb_set_trace:
  Don't force the user to reload the server.

Limitations
-----------

I specifically decided not to write any tests because this is a prototype.
