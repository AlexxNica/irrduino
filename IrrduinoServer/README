IrrduinoServer
==============

This is the server component of Irrduino.  It's a Python Google App Engine
application.

Running
-------

Make sure you have the Google App Engine for Python installed and run the
following from the current directory:

  dev_appserver.py .

If you want to setup an ssh tunnel from a public server back to your own
development server so that Irrduino can talk to your development server,
do something like:

  ssh -R \*:8080:127.0.0.1:8080 $USER@your-public-server.com

To deploy to the public server, just use GoogleAppEngineLauncher.  The
app is currently deployed to:

  http://irrduinoserver.appspot.com/

Global TODOs
------------

Add some real navigation.
Restrict access to the server.
Remove the hostname for Joe's server from the code.
Fix pdb_set_trace:
  Don't force the user to reload the server.

Limitations
-----------

I specifically decided not to write any tests because this is a prototype.
